My private and school projects

These are my privates projects or school projects. Some of the projects, I worked with my classmates and others myself.

You should use visual studio or Qt Creator to run some of the projects.














If you take the same class do not copy any of the projects you will get caught, the only reason my projects are public, it is because I want the recruiter to see what I have done so far in programing.
